        <p><strong>The Boring Company</strong> is an infrastructure and tunnel construction company founded by <strong>Elon Musk</strong> in late 2016. Musk has cited difficulty with Los Angeles traffic and limitations with the current 2-D transportation network as inspiration for the tunneling company project. The company was <strong>founded in 2016</strong>, after Elon Musk mentioned the idea of making tunnels on his Twitter account.<br>
By February 2017, the company had begun digging a 30-foot-wide (9 m), 50-foot-long (15 m), and 15-foot-deep (4.6 m) testing trench on the premises of SpaceX's offices in Hawthorne, CA, since construction on its site requires no permits. When told by employees on a Friday afternoon that it would take at least two weeks to move staff cars in the parking lot and start digging the first hole with the Boring Company tunneling machine, Musk said "Let's get started today and see what's the biggest hole we can dig between now and Sunday afternoon, running 24 hours a day." Later that day, the cars were gone and there was a hole in the ground.

        <p>The company began its consumer sales by offering 50,000 hats and once those sold out in January 2018, it began offering 20,000 flamethrowers for preordering. <strong>The Boring Company's</strong> flamethrower is a blow torch shaped to look like a gun and it is legal to use in all U.S. states except for Maryland. The sale of the flamethrower has attracted criticism, with politician Miguel Santiago seeking to introduce legislation that would ban sales of the device in California.<br><br> In just a few days, all 20,000 flamethrowers were sold out, but after customs official said that they would not allow any items called 'flamethrowers', Elon Musk announced on Twitter that he would rename them either <strong>"Temperature Enhancement Devices"</strong>or <strong>"Not a Flamethrower"</strong> and that all flamethrowers will ship with a fire extinguisher included. He settled on "Not a Flamethrower" and subsequently updated the Boring Company website where it also states that it is the "world's safest flamethrower". Musk also announced separate sales of the Boring Company Fire Extinguisher, which he described as "<em>overpriced... but this one comes with a cool sticker</em>".</p>
